            when it is no longer needed.
            </p>
            <p>
            Personal information collected through the Site may be used by us and
            our affiliates for purposes of:
            </p>

            </li>
            <li>
            Providing the services you select through this Site;
            </li>
            <li>
            Tailoring and delivering targeted advertisements to you;
            </li>
            <li>

            Auditing, research, and analysis to maintain, protect, and improve
            this Site and our services;
            </li>
            <li>

            Although the sections above describe our primary purpose in collecting
            your personal information, in many situations we have more than one
            purpose. For example, if you complete an online purchase we may collect
            your personal information to perform our contract with you, but we also
            collect your personal information as we have a legitimate interest in
            maintaining your information after your transaction is complete so that
            we can quickly and easily respond to any questions about your order. As
            a result (and as permitted by applicable law), our collection and
            processing of your personal information is based in different contexts
            upon your consent, our need to perform a contract, our obligations under
            law, and/or our legitimate interest in conducting our business.
            </p>

            available products to their customers.

            necessary for entering into, or the performance of, a contract between
            the data subject and a data controller, or (2) is not authorized by
