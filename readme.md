# Spork - Frontend practice

I wanted to continue practicing my HTML and CSS skills after designing my restaurant tracking app, found [here](https://natzdan.com/spork.html). Every app needs a good website for Google to find, one that informs potential users about it features. So, a marketing page seemed like a good next step and way to keep practicing coding.

I had fun using CSS Grid and media queries to make [this page](https://thisisnataliessn.github.io/spork-marketing/) highly responsive and comparable to other app marketing sites.
